                   <p>From LaFerrari to the SF90 Stradale and 296 GTB, <br> Ferrari’s hybrid technology has produced some of the quickest and <br> most innovative road production cars ever seen</p>

            <h4>Words – Ross Brown <br>Video – Oliver McIntyre</h4>
            <br>
            <h1>The dawn of racing hybrid power came with <br>the 
                arrival of the kinetic energy recovery  <br> system (KERS), fully introduced to Formula 
                <br>One for the 2009 season.
            </h1>
            <h4>A complicated idea for its time, few manufacturers initially leapt at the <br>chance of harnessing electricity to their tried-and-trusted racing <br>powertrains.</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Ultimately Ferrari were one of only four teams to adopt the system, along with McLaren, Renault <br> and BMW. The results for the Scuderia were immediate, and Kimi Raikkonen became the first <br> person to win a race in a KERS equipped car when his Ferrari crossed the finish line at the Belgian <br> Grand Prix that year. 
            </p>

                <video class="vd" controls autoplay>
                    <source src="img/vd-d.mp4">
                </video>
                <ul><i>From cutting edge F1 technology to innovative integrated power units, Ferrari's hybrid technology <br> <i>puts a new emphasis on acceleration</i> </i>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p> Although still in its infancy, KERS had proved that electricity had a clear role to play in future Ferrari <br> success and a mere four years later, at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013, Ferrari unveiled LaFerrari, <br> the most powerful production car they had ever built. </p>
            <p> Combining the 9250 rpm V12 engine with the F1-derived HY-KERS system, the 963 cv limited-edition <br> road car was blisteringly quick, moving from a standing start to 200km/hr in 6.9 seconds and <br> continuing to accelerate right up to 350 km/hr. Electricity had proved its point, and LaFerrari <br> opened the doors for the next generation of Ferrari hybrid road cars: the SF90 Stradale and the <br> 296 GTB.
            </p>

<!--i1-->
            <div class="about-img">
                <img class="vd" src="img/1.jpg" alt="">
                <ul><i>Combining the V12 engine with an F1 derived HY-KERS system made LaFerrari the fastest road <br> production car Ferrari had ever built</i>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Unlike LaFerrari, which produced its KERS energy internally, both the SF90 Stradale and the 296 <br> GTB utilise plug-in hybrid technology, providing each with 25 kilometres of pure electric range.  But <br> it’s when electricity meets combustion that the real fun begins.</p>
            <p>As the first ever PHEV Ferrari, the SF90’s V8 combustion engine works alongside not one, but three <br> electric motors, two of which are independent and located on the front axle, with the third at the <br> rear between the engine and the gearbox.  </p>
            <p>Even without electrical assistance, the SF90’s turbo charged V8 is a formidable piece of <br> engineering, thumping out 780 cv, the highest power output of any 8-cylinder in Ferrari history. The <br> three batteries then provide a further 220 cv and when all are combined with the V8, the SF90’s <br> sudden 1000 cv will send the car from zero to 100 kms/hr in 2.5 seconds and continue on to 339 <br> km/hr. </p>

            <div class="about-img">
                <img class="vd" src="img/d2.jpg" alt="">
                <ul><i>The first Ferrari road car with rear-wheel drive PHEV, the turbo charged V6 is integrated with a <br> rear electric motor that delivers 830cv 
                </i>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>But while the SF90, much like the LaFerrari before it, has its hybrid technology firmly focused on <br> peak performance, the 296 GTB, unveiled this summer, is aimed at pure emotional enjoyment. The <br> clear link between road car and Ferrari’s racing pedigree lies in the turbocharged V6 engine: <br> the turbocharged V6 powered 126 C2 won the Formula One World Championship in 1982 and the <br> hybrid V6 turbo architecture has been standard on all Formula 1 cars since 2014.</p>
            <p>This however is the first Ferrari road car with rear-wheel drive PHEV, which means that the <br> turbocharged V6 is integrated with a rear electric motor. Combining the engine with instant <br> electrical acceleration delivers 830cv that provides a 0-100 km/hr time of 2.9 seconds and a top <br>   speed of 330 km/hr.</p>

<!--3-->
            <div class="about-img">
                <img class="vd" src="img/d3.jpg" alt="">
                <ul><i>Ferrari's first ever PHEV road car: the SF90's turbo charged V8 works alongside not one but <br> three electric motors, combining to deliver 1000 cv
                </i>
                </ul>
            </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It’s also worth noting that when you do so, the V6 soundtrack becomes pure V12 harmonics. The <br> instant acceleration, combined with the V12 soundtrack from the short wheelbase Berlinetta all <br> work together to deliver a car that pushes the boundaries to the limit and makes it so much fun to <br> drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the cutting-edge technology of the F1 circuit to the innovative integrated power units of <br> their road cars, one thing remains clear: hybrid technology for Ferrari will always be fast. Very <br> fast indeed.
